# Major-league-Soccer-Analytics

Objective:
The primary objective of this Independent Study Project (ISP) is to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of Major League Soccer (MLS) matches. By leveraging data analytics, the project aims to uncover insights into team performance, player contributions, and match outcomes. This analysis will provide valuable information that can inform strategic decisions for teams, coaches, and analysts within the MLS.

## Key Components:

- Introduction:

Context: MLS is a rapidly growing football league with a significant following and a wealth of data available for analysis.
Purpose: To explore the intersection of sports and data analytics, offering insights into the dynamics of MLS matches.

- Dataset:

Source: Data will be sourced from reputable football statistics providers such as MLS Stats.
Content: The dataset will include comprehensive match statistics, such as goals, assists, shots on target, possession, passes completed, and defensive actions.
Justification: The dataset is chosen for its thorough coverage of in-game events and reliability within the football analytics community.

- Plan for Analysis:

Tools: Python within JupyterLab will be used for data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis.
Methods: The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling.
Goals: To extract insights into team and player performance, understand match dynamics, and predict outcomes.

- Potential Roadblocks and Challenges

Data Quality: Issues such as missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset will be addressed through thorough data validation and cleaning procedures using Python libraries like Pandas.
Seasonal Constraints: The current analysis will focus on the ongoing MLS season, leveraging fresh and relevant data to provide timely insights. The completion of the Premier League season limits data availability from that league
